# GomoBook
Create Database for Gomoku. In future, I will create a book for some opening with this source
# Some explain
So as to create a Database, put the PGN file (of Gomoku) into the Data directory then run Create Database.py
So as to use the Database for search, run Gomobook.py

Note: This program still in development, if you have some ideas, contact me via email: nguyencongminh050@gmail.com. Thanks
